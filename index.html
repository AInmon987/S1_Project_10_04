        <p>Robert Frost was born in San Francisco on March 26, 1874.
            While still a young boy, Frost's father died and the family moved to
            Massachusetts. Frost attended Dartmouth College for less than a semester,
            after which he moved back to Massachusetts to teach and work as a reporter
            for a local newspaper. Frost returned to college in 1897 to attend Harvard,
            but he did not graduate. Frost was essentially a self-educated man.
        </p>

        <p>After Harvard, Frost married and sold the farm he had inherited. With
            the proceeds of the sale, he moved his family to England, where he wrote for
            ten years without success. His first works were published by a
            London publisher in 1913.
        </p>

        <p>Frost's works, once printed, met immediate acclaim. His collection of
            poems <i>A Further Range</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Though he is
            sometimes cast as a pastoral poet, Frost was also a fierce intellectual with
            a decidedly dark view of himself and the world. Frost would use rural
            settings as a metaphor for his philosophical views. Robert Frost is one of
            the best-known and most beloved of American poets. He died in Boston on
            January 29, 1963.
